 Before coming to Fitchburg State University, I have fancied the world
of Game Design.  My aspirations is to become a better 3D Environmental Artist and looking forward to an internship so I may better the skill set I currently have.  My background includes Autodesk Maya/3DS Max primarily, Photoshop and ZBrush second, have dabbled with Motion Builder for animation work, and used both Unity and Unreal Engine.

   My goals are to not only become better at what it is I can do, but be
an asset to whatever team I find myself to be apart of.
