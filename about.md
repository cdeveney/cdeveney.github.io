 Before coming to Fitchburg State University, I fancied the world
of Game Design.  My aspirations are to become a better 3D Environmental Artist, and looking forward to an internship so I may better the skill set I already have.  My professional background includes Autodesk Maya, 3DS Max, and Motionbuilder, Photoshop, ZBrush, Unity, and Unreal Engine 4.

   My goal is to not only improve myself, but be an asset to my team.
